# Baker's Dozen
###Project 2

####Idea
Baker's Dozen is an app where you can keep your favorite bakedgoods recipes and have them displayed beautifully.

####App Structure
I structured the app so that nothing was accessible unless you logged into an account. I utilized a Javascript if statement to determine if the currentUser was logged in.

I created a Pastry model that listed multiple properties of the pastry in question.

####Technologies Used:
-HTML 5
-CSS 3
-Javascript
-EJS
-Express
-Mongoose
-MongoDB
-Node.js

####Unsolved Problems
I could not get the pastry model to create ingredients in a list form, so I decided to leave that functionality out. I also had issues centering the nav icons and allowing the lock icon to log you out if you clicked on it.

####Future Functionality
I would like to rearrange the index page so that you can see more items at once and have it available for display to the public. The page acts like a storefront where the customer has the option to order the bakedgoods you list on your site. That way, no matter whether you are a professional or amateur baker, you have a well-designed platform to sell your bakedgoods on.
